          <p>Another good watch might be Dan Da Dan. My wife seems to enjoy it even though she's not an avid anime watcher, so i think its a decent anime to get into. I've also shown it to a couple of my friends and they seemed to like it as well. Side note: Ep. 7 mad eme cry a little

          <p>This is Honestly one of my favorite anime that I have watched. This is more of one that you kind of have to actively watch, instead of having it on the background.</p>

          <p>This one is really funny to watch to be honest. I was laughing pretty much every episode</p>

          <p> This is one of my favorites. The animation certainly gets better towards the later episodes though. </p>

          <p>Yeah this one is kind of a give. It's so popular Netflix is making a live action adaptation of it. It's been going on for a while now but its still a good watch if you have the time to invest into it. P.S. I cried over a boat

          <p>I enjoyed this anime a lot. It has a good mix of action, romance, and psychological thriller. The plot is very engaging and the characters are well developed. If you like anime with a bit of a dark twist, then this is definitely one to check out.

          <h3>Naruto</h3>

          <p>One of my personal favorites, so this is honestly biased. But Naruto is a great anime to start with. It has a lot of episodes but its worth the watch. The story is great and the characters are well developed. Just be prepared for some filler episodes along the way.

          <p>Funnest anime I've ever watched. The main character is so overpowered that it's hilarious to watch him fight. The animation is top notch and the story is engaging. Definitely a must watch for any anime fan.

          <p> The fights in this anime are great. Its a little challenging keeping up with the plot line, but still a good watch. </p>

          <p>One of my favorite romance anime out there. The music is beautiful and the story is heartwarming. Just be prepared to cry a little bit. This is the reason I learned to play the piano.
